# tic-tac-toe

Board is diplayed in a 3 X 3 pattern.

The board spots are labeled left to right, top to bottom. Like so:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

This is a two player game. Each player chooses where they would like to place their mark. Once three matching marks are found, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, the person who placed those marks wins.
